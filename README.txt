Calculates wav files frequencies by using fft algorithm. Also visualizes volume of different 
frequencies with bars of different height.

It also sets the brightness of the background with the bar that is colored pink,
you can change the bar with left and right arrow keys

There are few limitations:
 -Only works with 44100hz wav files
 -Cant disable background color changing which can be annoying :)
